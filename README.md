create_sst
========

The goal of this script is to enable the creation of a Sound Selection Table from the results of Raven batch detection.

Requirements:
* Python 2.x
* A UNIXey environment (e.g. Mac OS X, linux). Possible that cygwin might work.

Foreseen Difficulties:
* batch mode tables may be able to have lots of different filename structures?
